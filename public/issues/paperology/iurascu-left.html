<p>The materiality of paper since early modernity has not been limited to the second-order cultural techniques of writing, drawing, and computing. As a modular and plastic medium, paper has lent itself to endless techniques of physical transformation &mdash; folding, cutting, pasting and modelling &mdash; which, in turn, have called for different modes of visual, tactile, and conceptual engagement. In its broadest sense, then, paper is play &mdash; a principle which led to the construction of this paperological object.</p>
<p>At my children's request, I built a simple, fully operational board game. I repurposed a notebook to lay out a basic dice race track with numbered squares, a distillation, of sorts, of several classic models of the genre (such as the <a href="https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O26343/the-game-of-goose-board-games-j-w-spear/#object-details" target="_blank">Royal Game of the Goose</a>, with its legacies of moral education) as well as several handmade toys I recall from my childhood spent in 1980s Eastern Europe. I had been working for a while with texts on cultures of publicity and the circulation of periodical literature, so this aspect too went into the composition of my paperological toy: advertisement clippings from <a href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_CGJRAAAAYAAJ/page/136/mode/2up" target="_blank">Wilhelmine-era German illustrated journals</a> found their way into the design of the squares, side by side with <a href="https://www.stampsoftheworld.co.uk/wiki/Romania_1979_International_Year_of_the_Child" target="_blank">postal stamps issued in Socialist Romania</a>, allowing players to navigate several historical spaces at once. Are postal relays and their paper infrastructures not the media-technological conditions that ground our belief in communication?</p>
<p>But something else helped me decide on the final design of the game: a text I had read with my students, Walter Benjamin's 1928 review of the “Toy Exhibition at the Märkisches Museum.” Paper fills the world of old toys Benjamin describes: a world of miniature “objects on the margins,” from decorative notes attached to sugary treats to cardboard dioramas, which can be torn apart and reassembled into endlessly new shapes in the hands of the players. The main techniques I used to finally put the game together &mdash; collages, ink-blots and cut-outs &mdash; might as well have told a different story. One that continues to resist reduction to a single medium or form.</p>
